* MeObjects *
MeObjects Library for Delphi is a light object extension to make object type small and powerful. It makes the object type
supports the ClassType, InheritsFrom and ClassName like the Class Type, but it's mini and faster than the delphi class type.
You can treat it as mini-class type. The MeObjects Library is the MeSDK core too.

* MeScript *
the MeSDK Script Engine Core. It's the functional script language engine. but not ready yet.

* MeAOP *
The MeAOP is Aspect Oriented Programming for delphi. IMO, the aspect is the general feature in fact. It's a helper for 
object-oriented programming to re-use the feature(function), such as the Login feature. Aspect Oriented Programming 
attempts to aid programmers in the separation of features, or the breaking down of a program into distinct parts that 
overlap in functionality as little as possible. 

  1. distill/separate the general features from many classes;
  2. many classes can share the feature, so it need not to modify many classes if the feature've been changed.
  3. no necessary to modify the method when adding a new feature to the method.

I treat the Aspect Oriented Programming as Feature Oriented Programming.
